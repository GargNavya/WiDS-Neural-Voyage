# WIDS: Neural Voyage

For your Week-0 tasks, so that everybody can come to a similar footing, here are a few links to get started with python and numpy:
https://cs231n.github.io/python-numpy-tutorial/

https://www.w3schools.com/python/

https://numpy.org/doc/stable/user/quickstart.html

We will start giving the lectures to start with the tasks later. By then, try to go through the above link and get comfortable with python, jupyter and numpy.

For those who prefer watching lectures you can refer to the below links however do refer to above documentations also while writing code:
